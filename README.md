## Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's a simple way to add or update project information:

1. Go to our [projects.json file](https://github.com/ZaK3939/design-kit/blob/main/public/projects.json) on GitHub.

2. Click the edit (pencil) icon in the top right corner of the file view.

3. Add your project information at the end of the file, following this format:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "Your Project Name",
     "designKitUrl": "https://link-to-your-design-kit",
     "contact": "your@email.com (or null if no contact)"
   }
   ```

4. At the bottom of the page, write a short description of your changes (e.g., "Add ProjectX design kit").

5. Select "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request".

6. Click "Propose changes".

7. On the next page, click "Create pull request".

That's it! We'll review your submission and merge it if everything looks good.
